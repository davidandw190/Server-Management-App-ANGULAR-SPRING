## Server Management Application

The application aims to be a scalable and efficient solution that can manage large-scale server systems effectively. This application uses Spring and Angular frameworks to provide a seamless user experience, incorporating a reactive approach in handling events with RxJS, while Spring Data JPA and MySQL ensure optimal database performance.

The project is built using as inspiration a series of courses from AMIGOSCODE and GETARRAYS, courses from which I have have gained a great deal of technical skills and best practices. The goal was familiarising myself with the Spring and Angualr enviroments, building an end to end fully fledged application. I experimented with projects, libraries and approaches and I got over many challanges along the way.

## Important

The project is devided intro 2 applications that communicate with eachother through REST API's
